        My name is Steven Armstrong, and my journey with sneakers has taken me
        from the classrooms of Brigham Young University (Information Systems,
        <br />
        Computer Science emphasis) to the heart of sneaker culture at Nike
        (2023-2024). Working there solidified my belief in the power of the
        <br />
        sneaker community. That's why I created SneakPeek360â€”a platform inspired
        by the desire to connect sneakerheads globally. I'm passionate about
        <br />
        creating a space where everyone can stay informed, trade, sell, and buy
        their favorite kicks. As a Utah native and graduating senior, I'm
        excited to see where this platform goes!
