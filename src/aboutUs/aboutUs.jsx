          My name is Steven Armstrong, and my journey with sneakers has taken me
          from the classrooms of Brigham Young University (Information Systems,
          <br />
          Computer Science emphasis) to the heart of sneaker culture at Nike
          (2023-2024). Working there solidified my belief in the power of the
          <br />
          sneaker community. That's why I created SneakPeek360â€”a platform
          inspired by the desire to connect sneakerheads globally. I'm
          passionate about creating a space where everyone can stay informed,
          trade, sell, and buy their favorite kicks. As a Utah native and
          graduating senior, I'm excited to see where this platform goes!
