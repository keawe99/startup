## AWS Notes

I have bought a DNS name called sneakpeek360.com using Amazon's Route 53 element. I also have an EC2 instance that I am currently renting to deploy the web app on a server in North Virginia. I linked the public ip address to my domain name and was able to get it certified.

## HTML Notes

For this deliverable, I created a web app using the figma layout that I had made prior to this part of the deliverable. I created six simple webpages for a user to navigate through as they login and create their own sneakpeek360 account. I added a little bit of CSS to make it look more appealing. Still looks a little static but I have a good view of where I want to head from here. I will add more html elements as I progress throughout this project, but for now we will stick with this.
