## AWS Notes

I have bought a DNS name called sneakpeek360.com using Amazon's Route 53 element. I also have an EC2 instance that I am currently renting to deploy the web app on a server in North Virginia. I linked the public ip address to my domain name and was able to get it certified.

## HTML Notes

For this deliverable, I created a web app using the figma layout that I had made prior to this part of the deliverable. I created six simple webpages for a user to navigate through as they login and create their own sneakpeek360 account. I added a little bit of CSS to make it look more appealing. Still looks a little static but I have a good view of where I want to head from here. I will add more html elements as I progress throughout this project, but for now we will stick with this.

## CSS Notes

For this deliverable, I added an embedded youtube video on the homepage screen to make the web page stand out more. I also added an all black background with white text, making it easy for the user to read. I also reformatted my forms to make them look more user friendly and appealling to the eye. I also added a verification page where the user can input digits individually when they receive a confirmation email. Lastly, I split the landing page into 3 columns so the user can see everything they need to see at all times.

## React Notes

For this deliverable, I had to download react and inject it into my current project. The initial set-up wasn't too challenging, especially since the directions walk us through it pretty easily. However, it took a while for the layout that I want to be created. It was a little challenging splitting up certain parts of my view pages into columns, so I created another separate view called latestDrops. From there, users can easily navigate to a page where the latest drops of sneakers will update.
