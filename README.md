[My Notes](notes.md)

SneakPeak is a platform designed to unite sneakerheads and fashion enthusiasts by offering a space to share collections, discover new trends, and stay updated on the latest in sneaker culture. Users can create their own profiles, upload photos of their sneakers, and curate their collections in one place. Like Instagram, they can follow other accounts that post about the sneakers and styles they love, creating a personalized feed of the latest drops, fashion collaborations, and industry news. The app also serves as a hub for discovering upcoming releases and trends, ensuring users are always in the loop. SneakPeak is more than just a gallery â€” it's a community where sneakerheads can connect, share their passion, and stay at the forefront of the sneaker world.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

1. Personalized Sneaker Feed
   Users can follow their favorite sneaker brands, influencers, and other collectors to create a tailored feed of sneaker releases, collection highlights, and fashion trends. This feature keeps users engaged and ensures they only see the content they care about, from upcoming drops to exclusive collaborations.

2. Release Calendar & Alerts
   A built-in sneaker release calendar that shows upcoming drops, limited edition releases, and exclusive collaborations. Users can set alerts for specific sneakers, ensuring they never miss out on a release theyâ€™re interested in. This keeps the app both informative and action-driven, making it essential for any sneakerhead.

3. Virtual Sneaker Collection & Trading
   Allow users to upload photos of their sneakers and create a virtual "collection" they can showcase, track, and update over time. Additionally, integrating a safe and easy way to trade or sell sneakers within the community would create a marketplace aspect, giving users more reason to interact with the app.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML**

  HTML will be used to structure the content of the app, including the layout of user profiles, sneaker collections, and the sneaker feed. It will define the basic elements like headings, images, and buttons, ensuring a solid foundation for the front-end interface.

- **CSS**

  CSS will be used to style the application, creating an attractive, user-friendly design. This will involve customizing fonts, colors, and layout grids to ensure a sleek, modern look that aligns with sneaker culture. Responsive design will be implemented so the app looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

  I have added more CSS to make the web app look welcoming and fun. I am establishing a sense of culture with the sneaker community by developing an all inclusive site for sneakerheads worldwide to connect and share their collections and ideas in one place.

- **React**

  React will be used to build the interactive front-end of the app. It will manage the dynamic components, like the user feed, sneaker collections, and real-time updates for sneaker releases. React's component-based architecture will allow for efficient rendering and seamless user interactions.

- **Service**

  The service layer will handle business logic, such as fetching data from external APIs (e.g., sneaker release info, fashion trends) and managing real-time updates for users. It will facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end, ensuring smooth data flow and functionality across the app.

- **DB/Login**

  Users will log in using their email and a chosen password. Google Authentication will be integrated for enhanced security, allowing users to log in through their Google account. This will ensure safe, hassle-free authentication while protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **WebSocket**

  WebSocket will be used to enable real-time communication between the app and the server. This will be crucial for live updates on sneaker releases, notifications for new posts in the user feed, and any other dynamic content that requires immediate synchronization between the server and the client. WebSocket ensures a smooth, responsive experience with minimal delay.
